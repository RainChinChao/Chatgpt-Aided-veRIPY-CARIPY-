All the chatting records can be found in chat.html. Please download this chat.html file and double click it.

The chat file contains the prompt for ChatGPT, procedures, original Python code of the example designs, and the generated VeriPy-accepted Python code.

In each chat example, it can be divided into 3 parts.
The first part contains the prompt for ChatGPT to give rules and instructions for the transformation from standard Python to VeriPy-accepted Python.
The second part is the original standard Python code that describes the algorithm that users need.
The third part is the emphasis of the prompt of the first part to increase the generation accuracy to realise a more stable output of ChatGPT for VeriPy to generate the hardware.

Users just need to modify the second part to their needed algorithm/design, then copy the first part and third part for ChatGPT to generate the VeriPy-accepted code.
